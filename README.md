===============

Source code for my personal web app. This is just a playground for me to try new ideas and write about it.

What is it?
-----------

Looking into redoing my personal site since my old ruby on rails on is quite out of date and ugly.

Goals
-----

I want to take this opportunity to learn Scala and the Play! Framework.

Web App Features:
- Have a Projects page that lists my personal projects
- Ability to add new personal projects by login into admin mode and filling out the project info to be stored in a MongoDB database.
